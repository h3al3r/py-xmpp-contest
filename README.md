XMPP server app written on CPython2.7

This package contains _just_ _another_ implementation of XMPP server application.
written on Python 2.7 and _MUST_ match RFC 6120 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120), so if you find any inconsistencies
please notify me as fast as you can.

It's very important to me. Thanks.
